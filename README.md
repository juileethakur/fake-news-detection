# Fake News Detection

This was our project that we made for my classes of Web Mining in Spring 2022

We did the following tasks:

• Scrapped labelled data from a news website using ‘Beautiful soup’ <br>
• Used the labelled data to train a classifier using SVM as well as Naïve Bayes Algorithm. <br>
• Compared classification reports of both to determine the efficiency in results.
